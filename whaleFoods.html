    Humpback whales have been observed blowing "bubble nets" to help them feed. The whale dives 
    down, then swims up in a spiral while releasing bubbles of air from its blowholes. 
    The bubbles float up in a column, keeping prey inside the column. The whale lunges up through 
    the center of the column with its mouth open. Observers have seen several humpback whales 
    lunge-feeding up through a "bubble net", one at a time.
