    <h1> Humpback Whales</h1>
    <P>The humpback whale is a species of baleen whale. It is a rorqual and is the only species 
        in the genus Megaptera. Adults range in length from 14–17 m and weigh up to 40 metric 
        tons. The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and tubercles on
         its head.

    <h2>How to Identify</h3>
    <p>
            Humpback whales’ bodies are primarily black, but individuals have different amounts 
            of white on their pectoral fins, bellies, and the undersides of their flukes (tails).
             Southern Hemisphere humpback whales tend to have more white markings, particularly
             on their flanks and bellies than do Northern Hemisphere humpback whales.
             Humpback whale flukes can be up to 18 feet wide—they are serrated along the trailing edge, and 
             pointed at the tips. Tail fluke pigmentation patterns, in combination with varying shapes and
             sizes of whales’ flukes and/or prominent scars, are unique to each animal. They are distinctive 
             enough to be used as “fingerprints” to identify individuals. When photographed, 
             scientists can often identify individual whales—a process called 
             photo-identification - and catalog occurrences of individual whales and use this 
             information to track them over time.

<p>
    Humpback whales have been observed blowing "bubble nets" to help them feed. The whale dives 
    down, then swims up in a spiral while releasing bubbles of air from its blowholes. 
    The bubbles float up in a column, keeping prey inside the column. The whale lunges up through 
    the center of the column with its mouth open. Observers have seen several humpback whales 
    lunge-feeding up through a "bubble net", one at a time.
